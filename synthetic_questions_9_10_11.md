## DOMAIN 5: INVESTMENT BANKING (M&A) (75 Questions)

### Series 9.1: Accretion/Dilution Mechanics (15 questions)

**9.1.1 - ENTRY**: Explain the basic rule of Accretion/Dilution: If Acquirer P/E is 20x and Target P/E is 10x, and deal is 100% Stock, is it accretive? Why? (Cost of Stock vs Yield of Target).

**9.1.2 - ENTRY**: Calculate cost of debt impact: Acquirer uses 100% Cash. Cash interest foregone is 2% (after-tax 1.5%). Target Earnings Yield (E/P) is 10%. Is this accretive? What is the breakeven P/E?

**9.1.3 - ENTRY**: Model synergy impact: Deal is dilutive by $0.10 EPS pre-synergies. Acquirer expects $100M synergies. Share count 500M. Tax rate 25%. After-tax synergies = $75M. Per share = $0.15. Is deal accretive net of synergies?

**9.1.4 - ENTRY**: Analyze P/E relativity: Acquirer P/E 15x. Target P/E 20x. Deal 100% Stock. Is it accretive? Why does paying a higher multiple dilute shareholders?

**9.1.5 - ENTRY**: Calculate breakeven synergies: Acquirer EPS $2.00 (500M shares). Target Net Income $50M. Purchase Price $1B (100% debt at 5%). Deal is dilutive. How much pre-tax synergy is needed to break even?

**9.1.6 - INTERMEDIATE**: Compare Cash vs Stock: Acquirer P/E 10x (Yield 10%). Cost of Debt 5% (After-tax 3.75%). Target P/E 15x (Yield 6.6%). Which currency (Cash or Stock) makes the deal accretive?
