## DOMAIN 3: VENTURE CAPITAL (250 Questions)

### Entry-Level Scenarios (75 questions)

#### Series 7.1: VC Valuation Fundamentals (15 questions)

**7.1.1 - ENTRY**: A startup has $5M ARR, growing 50% YoY. SaaS multiples range 8-15x revenue depending on growth + profitability. For 50% growth with negative profitability, what's fair valuation range? How is this different from profitable SaaS?

**7.1.2 - ENTRY**: Calculate pre-money and post-money valuation. Startup raises $10M at $30M post-money valuation. Pre-money = $30M - $10M = $20M. What % of company do new investors own? What % do founders keep?

**7.1.3 - ENTRY**: Explain the VC Method: forecast exit value ($200M IPO in 5 years), apply discount rate (40% IRR = 10x money), back-calculate today's valuation = $200M / 10 = $20M. Pre-money = $20M - investment = $15M (if $5M investment). Does this make sense?

**7.1.4 - ENTRY**: Two comparable startups: one is pre-seed (idea stage, $1M revenue), another is Series B ($10M revenue, unit-positive). Which merits higher valuation multiple? Why? What valuation for each?

**7.1.5 - ENTRY**: Explain burn rate: startup spends $500K/month, has $5M cash. Runway = 10 months before running out of cash. If fundraising takes 3 months, they must raise by month 7 (3-month cushion). Why this timing urgency?

**7.1.6 - ENTRY**: A startup is "runway positive" (burns -$100K/month, positive cash flow). Valuation should be based on cash flows (DCF-like), not revenue multiples. Why? How does profitability change valuation approach?

**7.1.7 - ENTRY**: Compare three scenarios: (A) startup with $1M revenue, 100% YoY growth, (B) $5M revenue, 20% growth, (C) $10M revenue, 0% growth (mature). Rank by valuation multiple. Why does growth rate matter more than absolute revenue?

**7.1.8 - ENTRY**: Calculate customer acquisition cost (CAC): startup spends $200K on sales/marketing, acquires 1,000 customers. CAC = $200/customer. Payback period = 6 months (customer LTV = $1,200). Is this unit-positive? What's breakeven LTV?

**7.1.9 - ENTRY**: Explain "10x rule" for VCs: VCs want 10x return minimum on investment. If seed check is $500K and seed-to-Series A dilution is 50%, required Series A valuation = $5M (10x/$500K). How does this anchor future fundraising?

**7.1.10 - ENTRY**: A startup's SAM (serviceable addressable market) is estimated at $50B. TAM (total addressable market) might be $200B, but startup likely captures SAM only. How do you use TAM/SAM to estimate maximum exit value?

**7.1.11 - ENTRY**: Explain dilution: Founder owns 100% pre-seed. After seed: 20% dilution means founder owns 80%. After Series A: 40% of fully-diluted means founder owns 48%. Track dilution percentage and ownership % over funding rounds.

**7.1.12 - ENTRY**: A SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) is uncapped vs capped. Uncapped = no price negotiated, pricing determined at Series A (could be high/low). Capped = valuation cap limits maximum price. Which is better for investor? Founder?

**7.1.13 - ENTRY**: Convertible note: startup borrows $1M at 10% interest, converts to equity at Series A. If Series A sets $50M post-money, conversion price = $50M / X shares. What terms favor investors vs founders?

**7.1.14 - ENTRY**: Explain the "option pool" in equity: startup allocates 10% of shares for employee stock options. If founders own 50% (fully-diluted pre-option pool), post-option pool founders own 50% / (1.1) = 45%. How does this affect fundraising incentive?

**7.1.15 - ENTRY**: Use the venture capital method with probabilities: 50% probability of $100M exit, 30% probability of $20M exit, 20% probability of $0 (failure). Expected exit value = $50M + $6M = $56M. Required investment = $5M at 10x. Pre-money valuation?

#### Series 7.2: Due Diligence & Risk Assessment (15 questions)

**7.2.1 - ENTRY**: List 5 key diligence items for early-stage startup: (1) Market size / TAM (2) Founding team background (3) Product fit / MVP viability (4) Financial traction (revenue, burn) (5) Competitive differentiation. For pre-revenue startup, what matters most?

**7.2.2 - ENTRY**: Analyze unit economics: Churn rate 5%/month, LTV = $10K, CAC = $2K. LTV/CAC = 5x (healthy). But churn is concerning for SaaS (implies customer satisfaction issues). How do you weigh LTV/CAC vs churn?

**7.2.3 - ENTRY**: Perform market analysis: TAM is supposedly $50B. But realistic TAM (startup can capture) might be $5B (10% of market). Realistic SAM (in 5 years) might be $500M (10% of realistic TAM). Use SAM to estimate exit value.

**7.2.4 - ENTRY**: Evaluate founding team: CEO has 10 years startup experience (3 prior startups, 1 exit), CTO is expert coder but first startup. CFO has been CFO at 2 venture-backed companies. Rate team strength. What skill gaps exist?

**7.2.5 - ENTRY**: Competitive analysis: market has 10+ competitors. Startup has differentiation? Review: (A) faster/cheaper (commoditized), (B) better product (hard to sustain), (C) distribution moat (valuable). How do you assess durability?

**7.2.6 - ENTRY**: Analyze financial projections: startup projects 100% revenue growth 5 years. Industry growth is 20% CAGR. Are projections realistic? What assumptions matter (market share, pricing, unit expansion)?

**7.2.7 - ENTRY**: Understand investor protection rights: VC gets board seat (governance), information rights (see financials), liquidation preference (paid before equity holders), anti-dilution (protection if down round). Why does each matter?

**7.2.8 - ENTRY**: Perform cap table analysis: Founders own 60%, seed investors own 20%, option pool 10%, outstanding options 10%. Total = 100% (fully-diluted). If Series A adds 25% new ownership, what dilution to founders? New ownership structure?

**7.2.9 - ENTRY**: Assess regulatory risk: startup is fintech (regulated). Licensing requirements? Compliance cost? If regulatory barriers high, does this protect startup from competition (moat) or inhibit growth?

**7.2.10 - ENTRY**: Evaluate technology risk: does startup use cutting-edge tech that might become obsolete? Or is it proven tech where execution matters more? How do you factor technology obsolesce into valuation?

**7.2.11 - ENTRY**: Model survival risk: startup has $1M runway, needs 6 months to raise Series A, Series A usually closes within 3-4 months of starting (fundraising cycle). What's failure risk if fundraising takes longer?

**7.2.12 - ENTRY**: Analyze customer concentration: startup's top 3 customers = 50% of revenue. If any leave, revenue drops 17%. How does concentration risk affect valuation? What's the required buffer?

**7.2.13 - ENTRY**: Review intellectual property: startup has patents filed? Trademarks? Are there freedom-to-operate concerns (does startup infringe on others' IP)? How does IP portfolio affect value?

**7.2.14 - ENTRY**: Examine legal issues: any pending lawsuits? Employment lawsuits (ex-employee claims)? IP disputes? How do you model legal risk in valuation? Apply discount for unresolved issues.

**7.2.15 - ENTRY**: Assess customer fit: Is product solving a real problem or a "nice-to-have"? Customer feedback: 40% of early customers say "product critical to workflow" vs 20% say "optional." What level of product-market fit exists?

#### Series 7.3: Term Sheet Analysis (15 questions)

**7.3.1 - ENTRY**: Analyze a term sheet: $5M investment at $20M post-money (25% ownership), 2x liquidation preference (non-participating), anti-dilution protection (weighted average), board seat, information rights. Is this investor-friendly?

**7.3.2 - ENTRY**: Explain liquidation preferences: Participating means investor gets their money back first (2x), then shares proceeds pro-rata. Non-participating means investor gets either their money back (2x) or pro-rata proceeds, whichever is higher. Which is more investor-friendly?

**7.3.3 - ENTRY**: Compare anti-dilution types: (A) Full ratchet (worst for founders): if Series A raises at lower price, Series Seed gets bonus shares equivalent to full downward adjustment. (B) Weighted average (more fair). Example: how much worse full ratchet?

**7.3.4 - ENTRY**: Analyze a down round: Series A: $30M post-money. Series B (down round): $20M post-money. Series A investor has weighted-average anti-dilution. How many shares do they receive relative to original ownership?

**7.3.5 - ENTRY**: Explain board structure: founder + CEO is board seat 1. VC investor is board seat 2. Independent board member is seat 3. Does 1-2 represent investor control risk or appropriate governance? What's optimal board structure?

**7.3.6 - ENTRY**: Calculate effective ownership after a term sheet: Founders own 60% (pre-money). VC invests $5M at $20M post-money, buys 20%. Founders dilute to 48% (60% * 20M / 25M). Option pool is 10% of company, so founders further dilute to 43%. Track dilution carefully.

**7.3.7 - ENTRY**: Analyze protective provisions: VC has veto on new hiring above 5 people, new products, strategic pivots. Is this standard? Does it hamstring founders or provide reasonable control? What's a reasonable veto scope?

**7.3.8 - ENTRY**: Understand drag-along rights: VC has right to force founders to sell company (if VC votes to sell). Without drag-along, a single founder could block exit. Without this right, is VC's money trapped?

**7.3.9 - ENTRY**: Analyze liquidation scenario: exit value = $50M. VC has 2x liquidation preference on $5M investment (gets $10M first). Founders get remaining $40M. But if founders own 30% originally, this protects them from major downside. Model payoff.

**7.3.10 - ENTRY**: Evaluate warrant coverage: VC gets warrants to buy additional shares at favorable price. E.g., 10% warrant coverage means VC gets warrants for 10% of their invested shares. How does this increase effective ownership?

**7.3.11 - ENTRY**: Compare voting structures: (A) Preferred stock (VC) votes separately as class on major decisions vs (B) Common stock (Founders), both vote together on board. Which gives VC more control?

**7.3.12 - ENTRY**: Understand information rights: VC gets quarterly financials, annual audit, annual budget. Does this cost founders material effort? Does this provide value to VC (governance) or is it overhead?

**7.3.13 - ENTRY**: Analyze pro-rata rights: VC has right to invest in future Series rounds to maintain ownership %. If ownership dilutes (future rounds don't maintain %), VC feels they invested in wrong opportunity. How important is pro-rata right?

**7.3.14 - ENTRY**: Evaluate management rights: VC gets involvement in major hires (CRO, CFO), budget decisions, strategic pivots. Is this healthy board oversight or operational meddling? Where's the line?

**7.3.15 - ENTRY**: Calculate dilution from option pool expansion: Founders negotiate 10% option pool. Later, company wants to hire senior hires at expensive equity levels, needs 20% option pool. New pool creation dilutes founders further. How do you plan for this?

#### Series 7.4: Portfolio Management & Exit Strategy (15 questions)

**7.4.1 - ENTRY**: Model VC portfolio returns: VC makes 10 investments, bets $500K each ($5M total). Portfolio: 3 blockbusters (10x return = $5M each), 3 singles (3x return = $1.5M), 4 failures (0x return). Total return = $16.5M on $5M invested = 3.3x net (gross), less fees.

**7.4.2 - ENTRY**: Calculate J-curve: Early years of VC fund, NAV declines (investments lose value initially, distributions are negative returns). Years 5-8, exits begin, NAV rises (J-curve up). Why is this J-curve understood?

**7.4.3 - ENTRY**: Explain power law in VC: top 1% of investments (blockbusters) generate 90% of fund returns. Middle 40% break even or lose money. Concentrated bets matter. How does this affect portfolio construction?

**7.4.4 - ENTRY**: Model follow-on investment strategy: VC makes seed check $500K, needs to invest $2M more in Series A to maintain ownership dilution (pro-rata rights). Can VC afford to follow? What if opportunity cost is investing in new seed stage?

**7.4.5 - ENTRY**: Analyze concentration risk: portfolio has 15% of capital in one investment (largest concentration). Expected return 20x. If this company fails, portfolio return drops from 3.5x to 2.8x. Is concentration justified by upside?

**7.4.6 - ENTRY**: Evaluate synergistic follow-ons: VC's portfolio has 2 companies in similar space. Acquiring one another creates synergy. Should VC encourage M&A? How does this affect portfolio returns vs independent success?

**7.4.7 - ENTRY**: Understand exit timing: Company is acquired at $200M (VC's $2M investment now worth $10M). Founder wants to stay, build to $500M IPO. VC wants exit now (realize gain). How do you negotiate?

**7.4.8 - ENTRY**: Model IPO exit: startup going public, VC's $2M investment worth $20M pre-IPO. Post-IPO lockup (180 days), VC can sell. Market conditions vary, IPO pricing varies. How does timing uncertainty affect VC's planning?

**7.4.9 - ENTRY**: Analyze secondary sale: VC invested $2M at series A, now wants to exit early (fund nearing end of life). Secondary buyer purchases stake at $10M (5x return). Should VC take secondary sale or wait for IPO (possible $20M)?

**7.4.10 - ENTRY**: Understand write-off timing: VC's investment in company X is struggling. VC can write down to $500K (from $2M invested). Takes a loss now, or holds hope for future recovery. Tax implications? How does this affect portfolio returns and fund narrative?

**7.4.11 - ENTRY**: Calculate ownership dilution through portfolio lifecycle: VC invests at Series A (owns 20%). Series B adds 30% new investment, VC owns diluted to 14%. Series C adds 25%, VC owns 10.5%. Each round dilutes. What's final ownership pre-exit?

**7.4.12 - ENTRY**: Model interim funding: Company has 6-month runway, Series A close expected in 4 months. VC does small bridge round (another $500K) to extend runway to 9 months. Does this increase Series A ownership (dilution) or just ensure survival?

**7.4.13 - ENTRY**: Analyze portfolio-level risk: VC has 20 investments. Expected return 10x on 2 (blockbusters), 2x on 8 (good exits), 0.5x on 10 (struggling). Total portfolio return = (2*10 + 8*2 + 10*0.5) / 20 = 2.25x. What's downside risk if blockbusters fail?

**7.4.14 - ENTRY**: Evaluate board-seat strategy: VC takes board seats in 5 portfolio companies. Each board seat = 5 hours/month. Does this governance create value or consume resources? When should VC take board seat vs observer seat?

**7.4.15 - ENTRY**: Model bridge to exit: Company is in acquisition talks, expected close in 6 months, but needs $1M to continue operations (normal burn). VC puts in bridge investment at favorable terms (valuation cap). How does this maximize VC's return?

#### Series 7.5: Market Dynamics & Sector Trends (15 questions)

**7.5.1 - ENTRY**: Analyze VC market cycle: 2012-2016 was growth phase (rising deal volume, rising valuations), 2017-2018 consolidation (slower growth), 2019-2021 boom (COVID acceleration, record funding), 2022-2023 downturn (rising rates, valuations down 50%). Explain each phase.

**7.5.2 - ENTRY**: Compare pre-money valuations across sectors: SaaS (8-15x revenue multiples), Deep Tech (lower multiples, longer path to revenue), Consumer (brand-based valuation). Why do sectors vary? How does sector affect VC's required returns?

**7.5.3 - ENTRY**: Model valuations in rising rate environment: VC uses DCF with 40% discount rate (covers 20% risk premium + 20% time value). If rates rise 5% (time value component increases), discount rate becomes 45%, valuations decline 10%+. Why are startups sensitive to rate changes?

**7.5.4 - ENTRY**: Analyze hot sector rotations: 2020 boom = AI/ML, fintech, e-commerce. 2021 peak = fintech multiples 10x revenue. 2022 crash = fintech multiples 2x revenue. Why such dramatic multiple compression? Is this rational?

**7.5.5 - ENTRY**: Understand "spray and pray" vs concentrated bets: "Spray and pray" = many small checks in seeds, concentrated bets in Series A winners. How do these different strategies affect fund returns and diversification?

**7.5.6 - ENTRY**: Evaluate emerging market VC: India/SEA/LatAm startups growing rapidly, but exits smaller (strategic acquisitions by regional players). Valuations lower than US. Is higher growth rate offset by lower multiples?

**7.5.7 - ENTRY**: Analyze founder type evolution: early VC era = tech founders (ex-engineers). Recent = business/operations founders, celebrity founders. Do different founder types correlate with success rates?

**7.5.8 - ENTRY**: Model mega-round trends: Companies raising $100M+ in single rounds (uber-funding). Does this accelerate path to unicorn valuation or dilute venture capital into growth equity?

**7.5.9 - ENTRY**: Understand consolidation: Venture-backed companies acquiring other venture companies. Does this create returns or just shuffle existing value? How does M&A activity affect VC portfolio returns?

**7.5.10 - ENTRY**: Analyze geographic concentration: Silicon Valley has 40% of VC funding despite only 10% of population. Why? How are other regions building VC ecosystems?

**7.5.11 - ENTRY**: Model founder economics: Top founders exit with $100M+ in value, can self-fund next startup. Middle performers exit with $10-50M, may use for angel investing. Bottom performers get nothing. How does founder economics affect startup ecosystem?

**7.5.12 - ENTRY**: Evaluate sector-specific risks: Biotech (regulatory, long development cycles), cleantech (commodity price dependency), fintech (regulation). How do risks affect required returns and valuation multiples?

**7.5.13 - ENTRY**: Analyze remote work impact on startups: Pre-2020 = geographic concentration in hubs. Post-2020 = distributed teams, lower costs outside hubs, different startup types. Does this change VC thesis or just location?

**7.5.14 - ENTRY**: Understand AI boom impact: AI startups raising at 10x valuation multiples vs peers. Is this justified by technology potential or speculative bubble? How do you calibrate VC thesis during boom?

**7.5.15 - ENTRY**: Model demographic shifts: Younger founders (20s) have different risk/reward profiles vs experienced founders (40s+). Do younger founders' startups outperform or underperform?

## DOMAIN 4: PRIVATE EQUITY (250 Questions)

### Entry-Level Scenarios (75 questions)

#### Series 8.1: LBO Fundamentals & Mechanics (15 questions)

**8.1.1 - ENTRY**: Explain LBO mechanics: Buy company with 30% equity, 70% debt. Debt ($70M) is paid down using company's cash flow. After 5 years, debt reduces to $40M, equity stake becomes larger piece of pie. Example: revenue $100M, EBITDA margin 25%, annual debt paydown = ?

**8.1.2 - ENTRY**: Calculate entry valuation: LTM EBITDA $50M, entry multiple 8x, purchase price = $400M. Sources & Uses: Total uses = $400M (equity $120M, debt $280M, fees $10M). Fund commits $120M for $135M equity stake (includes management equity). Calculate equity % for fund.

**8.1.3 - ENTRY**: Model a 3-statement integration: Income statement forecasts revenue, EBITDA, net income. Cash flow statement shows cash available for debt paydown. Balance sheet shows debt declining, equity rising (retained earnings from NI). How do they interconnect?

**8.1.4 - ENTRY**: Explain leverage levels: 2x leverage (Debt / EBITDA = 2) is typical for stable companies. Higher leverage (3x, 4x) for better credit, lower leverage (1x, 1.5x) for riskier businesses. What determines optimal leverage?

**8.1.5 - ENTRY**: Calculate debt paydown: Year 1 EBITDA $50M, less interest ($20M at 7% on $280M debt), less tax ($10M), less capex ($10M), less working capital increase ($2M) = Free cash flow $8M. Debt reduction = $8M. Year 2 debt = $272M. How long to payoff?

**8.1.6 - ENTRY**: Analyze interest rate risk: Debt is variable (LIBOR + 400bps). If LIBOR rises 200bps, interest expense jumps $5.6M annually. How does this affect cash flow available for paydown? Should company hedge interest rate?

**8.1.7 - ENTRY**: Model covenant compliance: Debt covenants require maximum 3.5x leverage (Debt / EBITDA). If EBITDA declines 10%, leverage rises to 3.9x, violates covenant, triggers default. How much EBITDA headroom is needed?

**8.1.8 - ENTRY**: Calculate IRR from leverage: Entry equity $120M, exit (5 years) equity value $500M (from $50M EBITDA * 10x exit multiple). No cash distributions during hold. Gross MOIC = $500M / $120M = 4.2x. 5-year IRR = ?

**8.1.9 - ENTRY**: Explain MOIC vs IRR: MOIC = money multiple (absolute return), IRR = annualized return. MOIC 3x over 3 years = ~44% IRR. MOIC 3x over 5 years = ~25% IRR. When does MOIC understate returns (fast exits)?

**8.1.10 - ENTRY**: Model sources of return: Debt paydown ($40M), EBITDA growth (from $50M to $60M = $500M exit value), multiple expansion (8x entry to 10x exit = additional profit). Which lever contributes most to return?

**8.1.11 - ENTRY**: Analyze tax considerations: Company has NOLs (net operating losses = $20M). Can carry forward post-acquisition to reduce future taxes. How much is NOL worth if future EBITDA is $50M and tax rate is 25%?

**8.1.12 - ENTRY**: Calculate entry equity check: PE firm raises Fund V ($500M target). Invests in 5 companies, $100M per company average. Each company represents 5x revenue for fund ($500M AUM target requires 5x coverage). Is $100M check reasonable?

**8.1.13 - ENTRY**: Model add-on acquisition: After buying Platform company, PE makes 3 bolt-on acquisitions. Platform $50M EBITDA, Bolt-ons $5M, $3M, $2M combined. Consolidated = $60M EBITDA. How does this affect leverage? Returns?

**8.1.14 - ENTRY**: Understand recapitalization: PE holds company 2 years, EBITDA grows to $60M, leverage down to 2x (improving). PE refinances debt, takes cash out (dividend recap). Equity checks: $500M now (vs $400M entry). How does dividend change returns?

**8.1.15 - ENTRY**: Analyze exit multiple assumption: Entry 8x EBITDA, exit 9x. If exit 10x, returns increase. If exit 7x, returns decrease. How much does multiple expansion matter? What if exit multiple is same (8x) but EBITDA 20% higher?

#### Series 8.2: Operational Improvements & Value Creation (15 questions)

**8.2.1 - ENTRY**: Model EBITDA margin improvement: Entry EBITDA margin 20% (revenue $100M, EBITDA $20M). Cost reduction plan targets 100bps margin expansion (22%). New EBITDA = $22M. If multiple stays 8x, enterprise value increases $1.6M. What's % of purchase price?

**8.2.2 - ENTRY**: Implement SG&A reduction: Current SG&A = 15% of revenue. Benchmarking shows peer average = 12%. Target 13% (conservative). $3M SG&A reduction at 25% EBITDA margin = $3M EBITDA increase. How long to achieve? What's risk of cutting too aggressively?

**8.2.3 - ENTRY**: Analyze revenue growth: Entry revenue $100M, baseline growth 2% (GDP-like), but PE targets 5% through marketing, new geographies, product launches. At 5% growth, year 5 revenue = $127.6M. What's EBITDA impact if margins hold?

**8.2.4 - ENTRY**: Model pricing optimization: Current pricing is below market. Industry leaders charge 10% premium. If company increases prices 5%, volumes decline 2% (net +3% revenue). EBITDA impact? Risk of volume loss?

**8.2.5 - ENTRY**: Implement cost of goods sold (COGS) reduction: COGS currently 60% of revenue. Supplier renegotiation, scale improvements target 58%. 2% * $100M = $2M improvement. At 25% EBITDA margin, but reinvested in marketing?

**8.2.6 - ENTRY**: Analyze working capital optimization: Current receivables = 45 days sales outstanding (DSO). Target = 40 days. Cash released = 5 days * $100M revenue / 365 = $1.37M. Can this be deployed against debt paydown?

**8.2.7 - ENTRY**: Model asset optimization: PP&E currently $30M (asset-heavy business). Through outsourcing, capex can reduce 50%. Over 5 years, capex reduction = $2M/year. What's cash flow benefit?

**8.2.8 - ENTRY**: Understand management incentives: PE aligns managers with returns by giving them 2-3% equity stake (typically in SPV). If exit value $500M, management makes $10-15M. What behavior does this align?

**8.2.9 - ENTRY**: Analyze customer concentration: Top 3 customers = 30% revenue. De-risking = broadening customer base. New customers = lower margins but more stable. What's the return trade-off?

**8.2.10 - ENTRY**: Evaluate sales force productivity: 100 salespeople generating $100M revenue = $1M per salesperson. Peer average = $1.5M (more productive). Improving productivity through training, tool, compensation. Can achieve 15% improvement?

**8.2.11 - ENTRY**: Model geographic expansion: US company, 80% revenue from US. Europe is 1/3 market size, lower growth. Expanding to Europe adds $10M revenue over 3 years. What's profitability differential? ROI?

**8.2.12 - ENTRY**: Analyze product mix optimization: Company sells 3 products: A (20% margin), B (30% margin), C (5% margin). Shift mix to higher-margin products by focusing sales efforts. Can increase blended margin from 20% to 21%?

**8.2.13 - ENTRY**: Understand technology investment: Current systems are outdated (15-year-old software). Replacement cost = $5M, but generates $2M efficiency gains annually. 2.5-year payback. Should PE invest?

**8.2.14 - ENTRY**: Model M&A strategy: After platform acquisition, PE pursues bolt-on acquisitions to consolidate fragmented industry. Targets: 3-5 small competitors at 4x EBITDA. Consolidation value = 20% margin improvement. Why M&A strategy?

**8.2.15 - ENTRY**: Analyze value creation levers: Rank by potential impact: (1) Revenue growth +10% = $10M/year benefit, (2) Margin improvement +100bps = $1M/year, (3) Debt paydown (leverage up) = $5-10M/year valuation lift, (4) Multiple expansion (harder to control). Which matters most?

#### Series 8.3: Due Diligence & Risk Assessment (15 questions)

**8.3.1 - ENTRY**: Perform seller of a company's financial diligence: Check revenue recognition (should be less aggressive than buyer expects), EBITDA adjustments (remove non-recurring items, normalize). Seller adds back $5M in one-time costs (severance). Is this legitimate?

**8.3.2 - ENTRY**: Analyze customer concentration risk: Top 10 customers = 60% revenue. What's churn risk if any major customer leaves? Model revenue down 15% if top customer switches. How does this affect leverage covenant?

**8.3.3 - ENTRY**: Understand industry cyclicality: Business is tied to commercial construction (cyclical). Current cycle peak, revenues at all-time high. Should PE discount this? Model revenue decline 20% in downturn. What's leverage risk?

**8.3.4 - ENTRY**: Evaluate competitive positioning: Company is #2 in fragmented market, #1 has 15% share, company has 12%. What's competitive moat? Barriers to entry? Risk of competitor consolidation?

**8.3.5 - ENTRY**: Assess supply chain risk: Company sources 70% materials from single supplier (India). Geopolitical risk, tariff risk, supplier failure risk. Should PE diversify suppliers? What's cost?

**8.3.6 - ENTRY**: Analyze regulatory risk: Company operates in regulated industry (financial services, healthcare). Compliance costs are significant. New regulation could affect business model. How do you model regulatory risk?

**8.3.7 - ENTRY**: Evaluate technology risk: Company depends on proprietary software developed 10 years ago. Tech debt high, difficulty hiring engineers (legacy tech). Rebuild cost = $5M, timeline 18 months. How does this affect value?

**8.3.8 - ENTRY**: Assess talent risk: Company's key employees: CEO (irreplaceable skill set), VP of Sales (best performer, often recruited), CFO (competent but replaceable). Retention: offer CEO equity (already has), VP Sales new equity grant, CFO competitive salary. How do you retain?

**8.3.9 - ENTRY**: Analyze customer satisfaction: NPS (net promoter score) = 30 (industry average 40). Customer churn 8% (high). Are customers unhappy? What's the fix? Cost to improve NPS by 10 points?

**8.3.10 - ENTRY**: Review management team: Founder-led, limited management depth. CFO only finance person. Who replaces if transitions out? Hiring CFO + controller likely needed. Cost = $1M+ annually. How does this affect value?

**8.3.11 - ENTRY**: Evaluate strategic flexibility: Company is highly specialized (single product, single market). If market declines, company has no pivot. Diversification into adjacent markets could reduce risk. Capex required?

**8.3.12 - ENTRY**: Assess environmental / social / regulatory (ESR) risks: Company operates manufacturing facility. Environmental compliance risk, if violation could trigger $10M+ remediation. Social: labor practices scrutiny. How do you model ESG risk?

**8.3.13 - ENTRY**: Analyze IT infrastructure: Systems are outdated, security vulnerabilities, disaster recovery not tested. Modernization cost $2M. Cyber risk = potential $5M+ liability if breach. How do you quantify?

**8.3.14 - ENTRY**: Evaluate customer concentration in context: Top 3 customers = 35% revenue. But if these are large, stable Fortune 500 customers with multi-year contracts, risk is lower than if small, volatile customers. Context matters. How do you adjust risk assessment?

**8.3.15 - ENTRY**: Assess market dynamics: Market is growing 3% CAGR, consolidation underway (industry moving from 100 players to 10 within 10 years). Company is being consolidated BY someone or consolidated into consolidator? What's strategic value?

#### Series 8.4: Portfolio & Fund Dynamics (15 questions)

**8.4.1 - ENTRY**: Model fund returns: PE fund invests $500M across 5 companies ($100M each). Expected returns: Company A (4x), B (3x), C (2x), D (1.5x), E (1x). Fund net return = (4*100 + 3*100 + 2*100 + 1.5*100 + 1*100 - fees*5 years) / (500*1.05) = ?

**8.4.2 - ENTRY**: Calculate fee impact: GP fees = 2% annually on $500M fund = $10M/year * 5 years = $50M total. Performance fee = 20% of profits above 8% hurdle. Gross returns $1.25B, net after fees = $1.25B - $50M - 20% * (1.25B - 1B) = ?

**8.4.3 - ENTRY**: Understand distribution timing: Fund expects exits years 3-5. Early exits generate distributions, reducing NAV, but increasing IRR (early cash redeployed). Should GP encourage early exits or hold for upside?

**8.4.4 - ENTRY**: Model vintage year returns: Funds launched in 2008 (crisis) outperformed funds launched in 2007 (pre-crisis) because 2008 fund bought at low prices, 2007 fund paid high multiples. How much did vintage year matter?

**8.4.5 - ENTRY**: Analyze portfolio concentration: Fund has $500M, largest position $150M (30%). What happens if largest position becomes troubled (80% loss). Fund return declines from 2.5x to 1.8x. Is concentration risk justifiable?

**8.4.6 - ENTRY**: Evaluate diversification across sectors: Fund targets: 30% Consumer, 25% Healthcare, 20% Tech, 15% Industrial, 10% Other. Does this diversification reduce risk? Or dilutes manager expertise?

**8.4.7 - ENTRY**: Model pro-rata participation: Fund II invests $500M, Fund I invested $300M. Fund I LPs get pro-rata on Fund II best deals (pro-rata allocation). Does this cannibalize Fund II returns or ensure consistency?

**8.4.8 - ENTRY**: Understand co-investment: Strategic investor (other PE firm, corporation, family office) co-invests $50M in $100M deal (50/50). How does co-investment affect fund returns? Does it reduce GP's capital deployment?

**8.4.9 - ENTRY**: Analyze follow-on capital: Fund initially invests $50M (Series A funding round). Company grows, needs $100M in Series B. Fund invests another $30M (follow-on) to maintain dilution. What's fund exposure = $50M + $30M = $80M on one company. How concentrated is this?

**8.4.10 - ENTRY**: Model portfolio evolution: Year 1: 5 new investments. Year 2: 3 new, 1 exit. Year 3: 2 new, 2 exits, distributions begin. Year 4: portfolio mature, distributions accelerate. What's typical distribution timing?

**8.4.11 - ENTRY**: Evaluate secondary sales: Fund II wants to sell a Fund I investment (which has appreciated 3x) to a Fund III investor. Seller gets cash now. What's fair price? Does secondary market work efficiently?

**8.4.12 - ENTRY**: Understand management continuation: Fund I sponsors make 2% carry (profit on their invested capital). Fund II sponsors same. Do Fund I sponsors leave when Fund I done, or stay on as institutional sponsors for Fund II?

**8.4.13 - ENTRY**: Model clawback risk: Fund II sponsors realize they're underperforming hurdle in carry. May owe clawback to LPs if subsequent realized losses exceed previous gains. How does clawback impact incentive alignment?

**8.4.14 - ENTRY**: Assess denominator effect: Large pension fund LP allocates % of AUM to PE. When PE fund outperforms, pension's AUM grows, dollar allocation to PE-like strategies also grows (denominator effect). Does this help or hurt PE fund-raising?

**8.4.15 - ENTRY**: Analyze dry powder: Fund hasn't deployed all capital yet ($200M of $500M undeployed). Does dry powder help (flexibility for opportunities) or hurt (GP pressure to deploy quickly, overpaying)?

#### Series 8.5: Financing & Capital Structure (15 questions)

**8.5.1 - ENTRY**: Structure financing: $400M purchase, 30% equity ($120M), 70% debt ($280M). Debt breakdown: 4x bank term loan ($160M at 4% + 400bps), mezzanine debt ($80M at 8%), PIK toggle ($40M, cash or accruing). Why this layering?

**8.5.2 - ENTRY**: Calculate blended cost of debt: Term loan 4.4% * 57%, mezz 8% * 29%, PIK 8% * 14% = blended 6.2%. Why use expensive mezz/PIK? Leverage concerns if only term loan used.

**8.5.3 - ENTRY**: Understand covenant package: Term loan requires max 3.5x leverage, min 2x interest coverage, minimum cash balance $10M, cap on CapEx $15M/year. Which covenant most restrictive? How much headroom?

**8.5.4 - ENTRY**: Model debt paydown trajectory: Year 1 FCF $8M (debt paydown), leverage 3.2x. Year 2 FCF $10M, leverage 3.0x. Year 3 FCF $12M, leverage 2.8x. On track to exit at 1.8x leverage. Is this trajectory realistic?

**8.5.5 - ENTRY**: Analyze refinancing risk: Term loan has 5-year maturity, PIK after 5 years must be refinanced. If at year 5 refinancing isn't available (market down, credit spread wide), PIK can't be refinanced. What's contingency? Hold longer? Forced exit?

**8.5.6 - ENTRY**: Evaluate subordination: Mezz debt is subordinated to term loan. If company goes bankrupt, term lenders get paid first (up to term balance), mezz gets remainder. How does subordination affect mezz's risk/return profile?

**8.5.7 - ENTRY**: Understand intercreditor agreements: Term lenders (secured) vs mezz lenders (subordinated). Agreement defines: (1) Who gets paid first in bankruptcy, (2) Who controls workout, (3) Restrictions on mezz amending terms. How does this affect term lenders?

**8.5.8 - ENTRY**: Model leverage ratios: Entry leverage 2.8x (2.8x debt/EBITDA). Debt schedule: Year 1 $272M (2.7x), Year 2 $262M (2.6x), Year 3 $250M (2.5x). Spiral down to exit 1.8x. Is this realistic if EBITDA also grows?

**8.5.9 - ENTRY**: Analyze interest coverage: Year 1 EBITDA $50M, interest expense $19.6M, coverage = 2.5x. Covenant requires min 2.0x. If EBITDA misses (falls to $45M), coverage = 2.3x, still complies. How much EBITDA buffer?

**8.5.10 - ENTRY**: Understand financial policy: Company restricted by debt covenants from paying dividends (preserves cash for debt paydown). At exit, residual debt is repaid, dividend distributed to equity holders. How does leverage increase cash available for dividend?

**8.5.11 - ENTRY**: Model PIK toggle mechanics: PIK accrues interest at 8%, can toggle to cash or add to principal. Year 1 PIK $40M, toggle to PIK (8% accrual) = $43.2M. Year 2 still toggle = $46.7M. How does PIK growth affect leverage?

**8.5.12 - ENTRY**: Evaluate leverage scenarios: Base case 2.8x entry leverage. Stress case: EBITDA down 20% (recession), leverage spikes to 3.9x. What's covenant buffer? How much additional debt can be supported?

**8.5.13 - ENTRY**: Analyze cost of capital structure: Equity required to earn 20%+ IRR (risk). Debt required to earn 5-6% (lower risk). Leverage amplifies equity return. At what leverage does equity risk become too high?

**8.5.14 - ENTRY**: Understand leverage in downturns: 2008-2009 financial crisis: many leveraged companies faced refinancing risk, cash flow stress, covenant violations. How do you model for crisis scenarios in underwriting?

**8.5.15 - ENTRY**: Model amortization vs bullet: Term loan can be amortized (1% per year, refinanced at year 5) vs bullet (all due at year 5). Amortization = higher annual cash outflow but lower year-5 refinancing risk. Which is better?
