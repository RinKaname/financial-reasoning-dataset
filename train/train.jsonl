This phrasing is technically inaccurate for a standard equity position unless it refers to a *proxy* for the stock (e.g., a call option, a delta-one derivative that hasn't converged, or perhaps a beta-weighted exposure).\n    *   Given the context of \"delta\" and \"gamma\" provided together (0.75 and 0.05), it is highly probable that the question implies the \"stock position\" behaves like or *is* a Call option (Deep ITM, perhaps), or the question is asking to derive the Put delta from a given Call delta using Put-Call Parity.\n    *   Standard Put-Call Parity relationship for Greeks:\n        *   $\\Delta_{call} - \\Delta_{put} = 1$ (for non-dividend paying stock, or small div).\n        *   Specifically, $\\Delta_{put} = \\Delta_{call} - 1$.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{call} = \\Gamma_{put}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Solution:**\n    *   Assumption: The \"stock\" with delta 0.75 refers to the existing long exposure or a Call option on the stock that the manager is holding or using as a reference. Let's assume the question implies $\\Delta_{LongPosition} \\approx \\Delta_{Call} = 0.75$.\n    *   We want to hedge. To hedge a long delta (0.75), we usually need negative delta. Puts have negative delta.\n    *   The question asks for the \"delta of a 1-month put option\".

The relationship between the delta of a European call ($\\Delta_c$) and a European put ($\\Delta_p$) with the same strike and expiration is $\\Delta_c - \\Delta_p = 1$ (assuming no dividends).

Buy deep OTM puts (Portfolio Insurance).\n    *   **De-lever:** VaR constraints force selling.\n    *   **Basis Risk:** If hedging SPX vol with VIX futures, correlation might break.\n4.  **Draft Answer:**\n    *   Mark-to-Market: Liquidity management (Margin calls).\n    *   Tail Hedge: OTM options.\n    *   VaR discipline.\n</think>", "answer": "**Management:**\\n1.  **Mark-to-Market (Liquidity):** A vol spike triggers massive margin calls on short positions. Ensure the fund has sufficient unencumbered cash to meet these calls without forced liquidation of the portfolio.\\n2.  **Tail Hedging:** The strategy should always carry 'Convexity' protection (e.g., Long VIX Calls or Deep OTM Puts) to offset the linear losses from the short volatility book.\\n3.  **Gross Exposure:** Mechanically cut gross exposure as volatility rises (Volatility Targeting) to keep the Value-at-Risk constant."}
{"question": "A distressed investor is analyzing a turnaround situation. Model the required EBITDA growth, margin improvement, and leverage reduction needed to achieve a 20% IRR.", "cot": "<think>\n1.  **Turnaround Model:**\n    *   Entry: Distressed price.\n    *   Exit: Stabilized price.\n2.  **Drivers:**\n    *   **EBITDA Growth:** Fix ops. Margins 5% -> 15%.\n    *   **Leverage:** Pay down debt? Or Restructure (Debt-to-Equity).\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Entry Equity = 100. Target Exit = 200 (2x) or 2.5x in 5 years (20% IRR).\n    *   Reverse engineer EBITDA needed.\n4.  **Draft Answer:**\n    *   Margin expansion focus (Cost cutting).\n    *   Deleveraging.\n    *   Sensitivity table.\n</think>", "answer": "**Modeling:**\\nTo achieve a 20% IRR (~2.5x MOIC in 5 years):\\n1.  **Margin Expansion:** This is usually the biggest lever in a turnaround. If Revenue is flat, EBITDA must triple by restoring margins to industry averages (e.g., 5% to 15%) via cost cutting.\\n2.  **Deleveraging:** Distressed companies are often over-levered. The model usually assumes an initial **Debt Restructuring** (haircut) or rapid paydown using the improved FCF, shifting value from Debt to Equity.\\n3.  **Multiple Expansion:** Exiting at a 'Clean' multiple (8x) vs the 'Distressed' entry multiple (4x)."}
{"question": "A VC firm is developing a thesis on climate tech startups. Design the due diligence framework, key metrics, and exit scenarios.", "cot": "<think>\n1.  **Climate Tech Thesis:**\n    *   Decarbonization (Energy, Transport, Ag, Industry).\n2.  **Due Diligence:**\n    *   **Tech Risk:** Is it science or engineering? (Fusion vs Software). Science risk is bad for VC.\n    *   **Green Premium:** Is it cheaper than fossil fuels? (Bill Gates).\n    *   **Regulatory:** Does it need a subsidy (IRA/Carbon Credit) to work?\n    *   **Scalability:** Hardware scaling is hard (Capex heavy).\n3.  **Exit:**\n    *   Energy giants (Shell/BP).\n    *   Industrials (Siemens).\n    *   IPO (if huge).\n4.  **Draft Answer:**\n    *   Tech Readiness Level (TRL).\n    *   Unit Economics (Green Premium).\n    *   Capex intensity.\n</think>", "answer": "**Framework:**\\n1.  **Tech Readiness:** Assess TRL (Technology Readiness Level). Avoid 'Science Projects' (TRL 1-3). Focus on engineering scaling (TRL 7-9).\\n2.  **The Green Premium:** Does the product cost *more* than the dirty alternative? If yes, is the premium shrinking? Mass adoption requires parity.\\n3.  **Unit Economics:** Beware of Capex-heavy hardware models. Look for software-like margins or modular hardware.\\n4.  **Regulatory Dependency:** Stress test the business model without subsidies (e.g., what if the IRA is repealed?)."}
{"question": "A PE fund is evaluating a dividend recapitalization opportunity. Model the impact on leverage, cash flow, and exit returns. What are the risks?", "cot": "<think>\n1.  **Div Recap:** Borrow money to pay dividend.\n2.  **Model:**\n    *   **New Debt:** Add $100M senior debt.\n    *   **Cash Flow:** Pay $100M to PE.\n    *   **Leverage:** Jumps from 3x to 5x.\n    *   **Exit Return:**\n        *   Early cash boosts IRR.\n        *   Higher debt reduces Exit Equity value.\n        *   Net result: Higher IRR, similar MOIC (minus interest).\n3.  **Risks:**\n    *   **Default:** Higher interest burden. Less FCF cushion.\n    *   **Rating:** Downgrade?\n    *   **Exit:** Harder to sell a highly levered company?\n4.  **Draft Answer:**\n    *   Boosts IRR (Time value).\n    *   Increases Default Risk (Interest burden).\n    *   Lowers debt capacity for growth.\n</think>", "answer": "**Modeling:**\\n1.  **Cash Flow:** The recap pulls forward cash to Year N (the dividend). This dramatically increases **IRR** due to the time value of money.\\n2.  **Leverage:** It spikes the leverage ratio (e.g., from 3x to 5x). \\n3.  **Exit Returns:** The final equity check at exit will be smaller (because the debt must be repaid), but the Total Value (Dividend + Exit) usually remains similar, just distributed differently.\\n\\n**Risks:**\\nIt consumes the company's debt capacity, leaving no room for error or future M&A. It increases interest expense, reducing Free Cash Flow and increasing the probability of default in a downturn."}
