{"question": "A portfolio manager holds a long position in a stock and wants to hedge using put options.

This phrasing is technically inaccurate for a standard equity position unless it refers to a *proxy* for the stock (e.g., a call option, a delta-one derivative that hasn't converged, or perhaps a beta-weighted exposure).\n    *   Given the context of \"delta\" and \"gamma\" provided together (0.75 and 0.05), it is highly probable that the question implies the \"stock position\" behaves like or *is* a Call option (Deep ITM, perhaps), or the question is asking to derive the Put delta from a given Call delta using Put-Call Parity.\n    *   Standard Put-Call Parity relationship for Greeks:\n        *   $\\Delta_{call} - \\Delta_{put} = 1$ (for non-dividend paying stock, or small div).\n        *   Specifically, $\\Delta_{put} = \\Delta_{call} - 1$.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{call} = \\Gamma_{put}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Solution:**\n    *   Assumption: The \"stock\" with delta 0.75 refers to the existing long exposure or a Call option on the stock that the manager is holding or using as a reference. Let's assume the question implies $\\Delta_{LongPosition} \\approx \\Delta_{Call} = 0.75$.\n    *   We want to hedge. To hedge a long delta (0.75), we usually need negative delta. Puts have negative delta.\n    *   The question asks for the \"delta of a 1-month put option\". It doesn't specify *which* put option (strike), but typically in these textbook problems, it implies the put option with the *same* strike/maturity as the instrument described (the \"stock\" acting like a call).\n    *   Using Put-Call Parity:\n        *   If $\\Delta_{Call} = 0.75$.\n        *   Then $\\Delta_{Put} = 0.75 - 1.0 = -0.25$.\n    *   Gamma: The gamma of the put is identical to the gamma of the call (0.05).\n    *   Result: The put delta is approximately -0.25.\n\n4.  **Refine the Answer:**\n    *   Explain the likely interpretation of \"stock has delta 0.75\" (likely referring to a call option or a specific derivative position, as physical stock has delta 1).\n    *   Apply Put-Call Parity.\n    *   State the result clearly.\n</think>", "answer": "Assuming the problem implies that the existing position (referred to as 'stock') behaves like a Call option with a delta of 0.75 (since physical stock typically has a delta of 1 and gamma of 0), we can use Put-Call Parity to find the delta of the corresponding Put option. The relationship between the delta of a European call ($\\Delta_c$) and a European put ($\\Delta_p$) with the same strike and expiration is $\\Delta_c - \\Delta_p = 1$ (assuming no dividends). Therefore, $\\Delta_p = \\Delta_c - 1$. Substituting the given value: $\\Delta_p = 0.75 - 1 = -0.25$. The approximate delta of the 1-month put option is **-0.25**."}

It cuts off the tail but doesn't describe the *shape* of the tail beyond the cutoff.\n\n2.  **Define CVaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk):** Also known as Expected Shortfall (ES).

In these scenarios, extreme loss events are more frequent and severe than a normal distribution would predict.

This is effectively a short call option position for the MBS investor.\\n*   **Rates Fall:** Homeowners refinance. The principal is returned at par, capping the price appreciation of the MBS.

Valuation requires an **Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS)** model (like Monte Carlo) to price the embedded prepayment option.

This forces bankruptcy even if the company is operationally profitable.\\n2.  **Rate Shock:** If rates spike (e.g., from 5% to 10%), the interest expense on the new debt doubles.

Excess interest is carried forward.\\n2.  **NOLs:** Use Net Operating Losses to offset income.\\n3.  **Exit Tax:** LBO returns are typically calculated on a pre-tax basis for the fund (GPs/LPs pay tax individually).

High CapEx drains the cash available to pay down debt. This slows deleveraging, which hurts the IRR.\\n2.  **Lower Debt Capacity:** Lenders lend against FCF, not just EBITDA. A high-CapEx business can support less debt.\\n3.  **Nuance:** Distinguish between **Maintenance CapEx** (required to keep lights on) and **Growth CapEx** (discretionary). You can cut Growth CapEx in a downturn to preserve cash, but Maintenance CapEx is a fixed burden."}

{"question": "Explain the concept of \"step-downs\" in PE fees.

After the Investment Period (Post-Year 5), fees typically 'step down' to be charged on **Net Invested Capital** (active assets at cost) and the rate often drops (e.g., to 1.5%).\\n\\n**Alignment:** This prevents GPs from collecting fat fees on 'zombie funds'.
